# Divine Domains
*a brief description*

## Life Domain

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy – one of the fundamental forces of the universe – that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrci).

### Bonus Proficiency

### Disciple of Life
*1st-level Life Domain feature*

> *Your hands are blessed by your diety, amplifying your healing abilities.*

Whenever you use a Cleric spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to `2 + your Cleric level`.

### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
*2nd-level Life Domain feature*

> *You raise your holy symbol into the air, calling for the aid of your god. Then, the symbol glows with holy light as your comrades recover from potentially mortal wounds.*

As an action, you expend one use of Channel Divinity. Any number of target creatures within 30 feet of you recovers a total of five times your Cleric level divided as you choose among them. You cannot use this feature on constructs or undead.

### Blessed Healer
Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to `2 + your Cleric level`.

### Divine Strike
*8th-level Life Domain feature*

> *You can infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy.*

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Supreme Healing
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
