# Exploits


# What is an Exploit?
[insert explanation]

## Exploit Level
Every Exploit has a level from 0 to 5. An Exploit's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with 1st level being the weakest and 5th level being the strongest. The higher an Exploit's level, the higher level a martial must be to use that spell.

Exploit level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 5th level, to perform a 5th level Exploit.

## Known Exploits
Before a martial can perform an Exploit, they must have the Exploit firmly fixed in mind. Members of a few classes have a limited list of Exploits they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many martial monsters.

The number of Exploits a martial can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's level.

## Stamina
Regardless of how many Exploits a martial knows, they can only perform a limited number of spells before resting. Moving at superhuman speeds and performing feats of legendary strength is tiring, especially for higher level Exploits. That is why each class capable of performing Exploits tells you how many Stamina Points they have.

A martial typically has a number of stamina points equal to their Constitution modifier + their Martial Level.

See *Multiclassing* for a guide on calculating a character's Martial Level.

# Performing an Exploit
When a character performs any exploit, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the Exploit's effects.
