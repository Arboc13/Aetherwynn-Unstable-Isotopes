# Fighter Exploit List

## 1st-Level Exploits
Exploits of the 1st-level are minor techniques slightly more complicated than swinging a weapon.

### Aggressive Sprint

As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one Exploit Die to draw upon your battle fury and move up to your full walking speed toward a hostile creature that you can see.

Starting at 5th level, you can make a single melee weapon attack at the end of this movement.

### Arresting Strike
When you hit a target with a weapon attack, you can expend one Exploit Die and force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes bonus damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die and its speed is 0 until the start of your next turn.

Brace Up
Prerequisites: Constitution of 11
You steel yourself for combat, preparing yourself to take a hit. As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die and gain temporary hit points equal to 1 + one roll of your Exploit Die.

Cunning Instinct
Prerequisites: Dexterity of 11

When you make a Wisdom (Perception) or a Wisdom (Survival) check you can expend one Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your ability check. You can do so after you roll the d20, but before you know if you succeed or fail.

Disarm
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes additional damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die, and it drops one item of your choice that it is currently holding on the ground at its feet.

Eloquent Speech
Prerequisites: Intelligence or Charisma of 11

Whenever you would make a Charisma (Persuasion) check you can make an Intelligence (Persuasion) check instead.

When you make an Intelligence (Persuasion) or Charisma (Persuasion) check you can expend one Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your ability check. You can do so after you roll the d20, but before you know if you succeed or fail.

Feat of Strength
Prerequisites: Strength or Constitution of 11

When you make a Strength or Constitution ability check you can expend Exploit Dice (up to your proficiency bonus), roll those dice, and add the result to your ability check.

Feint
As a bonus action, you can expend one Exploit Die to feint, forcing a creature that can see you within 15 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on all attacks against it until the end of your turn.
